# COLLUSION

* bribery attacks -- basically, allow the right to switch votes at no cost `=>` by this logic, any bond is also vulnerable to bribery in which the bribe transfers the rights to the collateralized asset at a discount  (could also be a premium in the case of a significant decision)
* one approach is to establish algorithms that slowly build internal reputation among members

* awareness of bribery / collusive actor dynamics 
* example: the scenario in which the processer is the proposal sponsor -- do we want to make this not allowed? or would we prefer to make it so that this isn't advantageous!
