# Inflation, Block Rewards, and Eventual Market Efficiency

* We want to design mechanisms for long-term use with the expectation of eventual market efficiency. In doing so, we contain the threat that inflation poses to the economic sovereignty of passive holders. 
* market efficiency is a stronger assumption => prefer closed loops
* eventual market efficiency
* *this turns into an article against Block Rewards...but that's not the point either*; the real point should be that even in inefficient markets, supply increases will *eventually* trigger decreases in price. If prices continue to increase, that doesn't mean that markets are inefficient; just means that prices would have increased more otherwise. Think about it in purely economic terms => assume that only demand drives price...even so, if there are less units, then each unit will be worth more. 
* When designing our own mechanisms, it is preferrable to assume market efficiency rather than a lack thereof. Stronger assumptions ensure that we limit threats to the economic sovereignty of the designated asset holders .
