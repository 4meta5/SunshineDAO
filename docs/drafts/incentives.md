## Incentivizing Voting

* not necessary if stakeholders have external incentives to work together (ie `MolochDAO`)

Sustained stakeholder interaction is nontrivial in a digital context (*see [AGP vote turnouts](https://forum.aragon.org/t/evaluating-the-agp-1-voting-results-makes-me-think-we-need-an-aragon-community-token-act/290)*). 

*random thought*: what if you made it so that you could issue shares as a tax on share ownership to incentivize positive behavior `=>` would be unnecessary if enough misbehaviors occur to justify taking collateral. Cost transparency is more important and, deducting fees for *inactive* behavior might be misleading if not properly communicated.
