## Incentivizing Voting

* not necessary if stakeholders have external incentives to work together (ie `MolochDAO`)

Sustained stakeholder interaction is nontrivial in a digital context (*see [AGP vote turnouts](https://forum.aragon.org/t/evaluating-the-agp-1-voting-results-makes-me-think-we-need-an-aragon-community-token-act/290)*). 

*random thought*: what if you made it so that you could issue shares for incentivization corresponding to the amount of shares lost due to lack of activity (which could be like a gradual tax on share ownership hypothetically)
