#  Some(forks)
I'm going to catalogue all of the seemingly viable forks that were considered during development. Because sunshine is generic, an application that chooses to use sunshine may prefer one of these forks, each of which has unique tradeoffs!

The [`module`](../../module) folder contains the most recent work without the stale *forks*

## Minimal Viable Moloch <a name = "mvm"></a>

[This module](./1) compares three different implementations of Moloch in the context of Substrate. Each implementation is quite minimal in the sense that each fits within a single file!

<!-- ## Loosely Coupled Modules (in progress)

* how to use multiple files in Rust in general
* how to build multiple interacting modules

## DAOception (in progress)

* how to use `EnsureOrigin` to implement *DAOs in DAOs*

## Instancing DAOs (in progress)

* running multiple variations of DAOs at the same time
* subDAOs for delegation and other common organizational patterns (besides pure hierarchy) -->
