/// A trait for a not-quite Linear Type that tracks an imbalance.
///
/// Functions that alter account balances return an object of this trait to
/// express how much account balances have been altered in aggregate. If
/// dropped, the currency system will take some default steps to deal with
/// the imbalance (`balances` module simply reduces or increases its
/// total issuance). Your module should generally handle it in some way,
/// good practice is to do so in a configurable manner using an
/// `OnUnbalanced` type for each situation in which your module needs to
/// handle an imbalance.
///
/// Imbalances can either be Positive (funds were added somewhere without
/// being subtracted elsewhere - e.g. a reward) or Negative (funds deducted
/// somewhere without an equal and opposite addition - e.g. a slash or
/// system fee payment).
///
/// Since they are unsigned, the actual type is always Positive or Negative.
/// The trait makes no distinction except to define the `Opposite` type.
///
/// New instances of zero value can be created (`zero`) and destroyed
/// (`drop_zero`).
///
/// Existing instances can be `split` and merged either consuming `self` with
/// `merge` or mutating `self` with `subsume`. If the target is an `Option`,
/// then `maybe_merge` and `maybe_subsume` might work better. Instances can
/// also be `offset` with an `Opposite` that is less than or equal to in value.
///
/// You can always retrieve the raw balance value using `peek`.
