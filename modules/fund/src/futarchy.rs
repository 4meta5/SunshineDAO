// so this is where we define criteria for pitches (to price collateral)...
// -- ...I want to make it so that the required collateral amount is always changing
// ---- initial design maintains full control over collateral, but eventually I would like to be able to negotiate use of collateral
// ------------for rights provision in a way that could "double-dip" collateral usage
// ------------I want to reimagine collateral requirements like how the demand/supply for the underlying effects margin requirements for shorts
// ALSO, need to basically set a target for investment decisions

// do monetary futarchy first
