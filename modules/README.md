# modules

* [committee](./committee), inspired by `council`
* [fund](./fund/), inspired by `treasury`
* [membership](./membership/), inspired by `membership`
* [voting](./voting/), inspired by `elections`

## why not just use original srml modules

they are optimized for Polkadot and not specialized for generic DAO usage
