**sunshine** is a [DAO](../README/#dao) framework. It inherits [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)'s modularity and leverages on-chain runtime upgrades for dynamic governance.

* [Design Criteria](#dsign)
* [Minimal Viable Moloch](#mvm)

## TODO

* consider reorganizing `=>` put `1/` in `docs` and then use the `modules` folder only for the live development.






## Design Criteria <a name = "dsign"></a>
1. **accessible**: usability determines the diversity of users as well as rate of adoption
2. **forkable**: modularity and extensibility facilitate the application of abstract mechanisms to more than one problem
3. **dynamic**: unambiguous on-chain runtime upgrades allow the mechanism to adapt and evolve
