# committee

like the council, but with significantly greater bias against low voter turnout for coinvotes. 

**responsibilities**:
* optimal asset allocation profiles for each participant
* proposals to change the group's asset allocation (should lag/align with individual allocation and have a `catalyst: IpfsHash`)
* spending projections for the next 12 `FuturePeriod`s (maybe months at first)
* each member can sponsor `MaxSponsorships` proposals per period (sponsored proposals are any that invoke the member's council authority to bring the proposal to a council vote and public referendum -- normal participants must crowdfund proposals for voting (or get sponsorship from council members))

**incentives**
* significant power over funding decisions

**checks and balances**:
* coinvote can reject proposals to change capital allocation
* coinvote can crowdfund collateral for proposals and force passage even in the face of unanimous committee dissent

## research

* how to decide on when to split power between multiple councils (how do we weight *council* vs *coinvote* preferences in this scenario)?

* how to make it so that members of this committee can be DAOs (or even hedge funds in the real world)?
