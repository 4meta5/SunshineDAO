**sunshine** is a fund coordination DAO on Substrate inspired by **[moloch](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch)**. 

**[modules](./modules)**::{[master](./modules/master), [metagov](./modules/metagov)}

<!-- ## technical features

- [ ] DAOs are first-class members
- [ ] Backward induction ie work our way back from real world use cases to discern practical mechanisms (specialize before generalizing) -->

### design philosophy

1. **accessible**: usability determines the diversity of users as well as rate of adoption
2. **forkable**: modularity and extensibility encourage granular configuration based on use case
3. **dynamic**: unambiguous on-chain runtime upgrades allow the system to adapt and evolve
