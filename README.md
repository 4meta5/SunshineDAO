**[Moloch](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch)** is minimally viable DAO designed to coordinate funding for the Ethereum ecosystem. Spearheaded by Ameen Soleimani, Arjun Bhuptani, James Young, Layne Haber & Rahul Sethuram, the DAO seeks to overcome the *tragedy of the commons* by incentivizing cohesion among the DAOs members in order to collectively fund open source work.

* **use Substrate when you want to build a community around your incentive mechanism**

* Rust is just safer than Solidity and doesn't come with all of the annoying quirks of working with the EVM
