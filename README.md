> "Over time, all the components of the DAO are likely to be upgraded using its own mechanisms...Given the high requirements for stability, **self-improvement will be critical to the survival of any DAO-based democratic system.**" ~[DAOs, Democracy and Governance](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf) by Ralph Merkle

`sunshine-bounty` is a governance chain written in [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate). It is experimental software. The design targets short-term developer contracts -- it may become something similar to Gitcoin or Aragon with organizations using the platform to post bounties and teams using the platform to pursue bounties.

To read more about the design, see the [Sunshine Recipes](https://sunshine-protocol.github.io/sunshine-bounty/)
