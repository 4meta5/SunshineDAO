# Bounty Pallet

This pallet placed 3rd üèÜ in [Hackusama](https://hackusama.devpost.com/submissions) with a demo that used the sunshine subxt client to automatically update github issue information based on changes to the on-chain state.

## Post Bounties

Anyone can post bounties as long as the amount is above the module minimum.

## Contribute to Bounties

Anyone can contribute to bounties. There are no refunds and there is no representation in fund governance.

## Apply for Bounty

Anyone except the poster can apply for a bounty.

## Approve Bounty

Only the account that posted the bounty can approve submissions. Submission approval immediately transfers funds to the recipient.

# Next Steps

This module works for single account governance, but isn't sufficiently expressive for democracy (direct and representative). Future versions will allow contributors to select representatives and vote to approve submissions. See the `grant` pallet for an example of an on-chain grants program that uses org voting to make grant decisions.
