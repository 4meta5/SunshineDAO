## Sunshine Recipes

Welcome! We're building governance infrastructure.

The software stack was carefully chosen to ensure resilience to capture and aspire towards censorship resistance. The blockchain is implemented with [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) to take advantage of the cutting edge in distributed network infrastructure. 

The network design minimizes on-chain state by storing sensitive data off-chain in [`ipfs-embed`](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/ipfs-embed) and only storing content identifiers on-chain. Efficient client-side networks enable the secure sharing of off-chain data among the relevant subscribers.

In a world increasingly fraught by data mismanagement (*the Cloud*), Sunshine stores all sensitive data on local hardware in an encrypted form. This architecture is conducive to modern key rotation mechanisms and client-side computation. It is inspired by [Local First](https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf) design principles.
