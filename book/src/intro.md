## Sunshine Recipes

Welcome! We're building voting infrastructure for FOSS ecosystem governance. More broadly, we're using cryptography to enforce capital allocation decisions for individuals and groups. 

[`sunshine-bounty`](https://github.com/sunshine-protocol/sunshine-bounty) expresses a platform for developers to form teams, request/apply for opportunities, and receive payment from on-chain foundations. This [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) serves to make code accessible to users and developers by providing high-level docs with clear examples.

Go to the *[splash](https://sunshine.foundation)* for more high-level descriptions -- Onwards, to the code!
