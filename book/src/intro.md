## Sunshine Recipes

Welcome! We're building voting infrastructure for FOSS ecosystem governance. Our goal is to use modern cryptography to enforce capital decisions for individuals and groups. 

Sunshine's first product is a bounty platform for developers to form teams, request/apply for opportunities, and receive payment from on-chain foundations.

This [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) serves to make our code more accessible to users and developers by providing high-level docs with clear examples.

**Sunshine Stack**
* [`substrate`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) is used to coordinate linearizable consensus on necessarily global state
* [`ipfs-embed`](https://github.com/rust-ipfs/ipfs-embed) is used to store sensitive data off chain, encrypted on local hardware
* QUIC and Noise are used for client-side communication networks
