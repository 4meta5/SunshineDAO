## Sunshine Recipes

Welcome! We're building voting infrastructure for FOSS ecosystem governance. More broadly, we're using cryptography to express governance and enforce capital allocation decisions for individuals and groups. 

Sunshine's first product is a bounty platform for developers to form teams, request/apply for opportunities, and receive payment from on-chain foundations.

This [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) serves to make our code more accessible to users and developers by providing high-level docs with clear examples.

**Sunshine Stack**
* [`substrate`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) is used to coordinate linearizable consensus on necessarily global state
* [`ipfs-embed`](https://github.com/rust-ipfs/ipfs-embed) is used to store sensitive data off chain, encrypted on local hardware
* QUIC and Noise are used for client-side communication networks
