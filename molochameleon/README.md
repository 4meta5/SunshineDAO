# MoloChameleon DAO

The MolochDAO logic is implemented in [`runtime/src/dao.rs`](./runtime/src/dao.rs). At the moment, the implementation is undergoing heavy refactoring.

Once it's more stable and testing has been added, I'll open it up for contribution and file a few issues with improvement ideas that I've been considering.

## TODO

* finish refactoring and initial implementation
* add more robust error handling
* add tests
* write blog posts and tutorial-style documentation
* iterate with optimizations
